**Frontend Developer Test Project**

**Objective:**
Build a simple, responsive webpage for a fictional "Product Showcase." This project assesses basic front-end development skills, including layout design, styling, and interactivity.

***

**Project Overview:**
You will create a two-page website, each showcasing **Bootstrap** and **Tailwind CSS** separately. This will help demonstrate your understanding of both frameworks.
